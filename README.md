Business analyst with a background in data validation, predictive modeling, and ArcGIS with skills in Excel, Python, and SQL from University of Texas at Austin’s data analytics boot camp.  In a team of four, recently developed a movie recommendation algorithm using data sets from IMDb, Python, Flask, and the K-means machine learning algorithm.  Constantly striving to find ways to streamline, automate and improve the throughput of myself and my colleagues through new skills and insights.  Most enjoy working on open-ended problem solving endeavors and applying skills to challenging data-centric projects.  High attention to detail, quick learning and ability to work with and train set me apart and make me an invaluable part of your team.
